  body: `The owner report should not be a monthly archaeology project.

Someone on the team exports leasing data. Someone else checks open maintenance items. Delinquency exposure is pulled from a different view. Turn status lives in another spreadsheet. Then a manager rewrites the same summary by hand before sending it to ownership.

For operators managing 50 or more units, owner reporting becomes a hidden administrative tax. It creates late reports, conflicting numbers, and repeated owner questions because the portfolio story has to be rebuilt from scratch every time.

## Why owner reporting breaks so often

The pattern is usually predictable:

- Leasing activity, delinquency exposure, maintenance status, and turn progress all live in different systems.
- Teams export data manually, then spend time checking which version is current enough to trust.
- Exceptions and narrative context stay in inboxes or side conversations, so the final report misses what ownership actually cares about.
- A new urgent issue appears after the report draft starts, and nobody knows whether the summary is already outdated.

This is not just a reporting discipline problem. It is a workflow design problem.

## What owner reporting automation should actually do

The goal is not to let software send unreviewed owner updates blindly. The goal is to create a controlled reporting workflow where routine portfolio updates assemble automatically and exceptions surface with context before the report goes out.

That means the workflow should:

1. Pull verified changes from the systems already running leasing, maintenance, delinquency, and turns.
2. Group those changes into the owner-facing sections your team uses every week or month.
3. Flag exceptions that need a human note before the report can be approved.
4. Keep the narrative tied to the underlying record instead of a disconnected spreadsheet.
5. Log what was sent, when it was approved, and what ownership replied to afterward.

If that process is clean, everything downstream improves: report timeliness, owner trust, internal alignment, and the team's ability to answer follow-up questions without another scramble.

## The owner-reporting checkpoints worth automating first

Most property management teams do not need a complicated AI layer first. They need a few reliable reporting checkpoints.

Start with:

- occupancy and leasing movement updated from verified portfolio data
- delinquency status changes pulled from approved account views
- major maintenance, make-ready, and vendor exceptions summarized from live workflow states
- owner-approval items or unusual spend flagged for review
- unresolved exceptions held for a human note before send
- delivered report logged back to the operating record automatically

Those checkpoints are enough to tell whether the report can move forward, needs clarification, or should pause for human review.

## Where automation should stop

Owner reporting automation should narrow the prep work, not replace judgment.

If the report includes disputed balances, legal or compliance-sensitive issues, unusual owner communication, market-specific context, or anything that needs explanation beyond the raw workflow state, the system should stop and hand the draft to staff with the right supporting details.

The point is to remove repetitive report assembly while making it easier for trained staff to step in with a cleaner record.

## How EMC2Ops would implement it

We would start by mapping how your team currently builds owner reports: which systems hold the truth for leasing, delinquency, maintenance, and turns; which sections ownership expects every cycle; which exceptions always require commentary; and where teams waste the most prep time reconciling numbers.

From there we would set:

1. The verified data sources and timing rules for each report section.
2. The exception thresholds that force a human review step.
3. The owner-facing narrative templates for routine status changes.
4. The PMS, CRM, and reporting write-backs that preserve what was sent and approved.
5. The metrics that show whether the workflow is reducing prep time and follow-up confusion.

If your team still rebuilds owner reports from exports, inboxes, and side spreadsheets, owner reporting automation is a strong place to automate next.`,
