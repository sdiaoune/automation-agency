  body: `A past-due balance should not create a second shadow workflow.

The resident may have received one reminder but not the next one. Someone on the onsite team may have a promise-to-pay note in email. Ownership may be asking for exposure on accounts that already changed status this morning. By the afternoon, nobody is confident which balances still need action and which ones already moved.

For operators managing 50 or more units, delinquency outreach becomes a hidden administrative tax. It creates inconsistent follow-up, duplicate resident contact, reporting gaps, and late escalations because the collections process leaves the system the moment teams start managing it by hand.

## Why delinquency follow-up breaks so often

The pattern is usually predictable:

- The due date passes, but reminder timing depends on whether a specific staff member notices the balance.
- A resident replies with a payment promise, hardship note, or dispute, and that context never reaches the next person touching the account.
- Ownership asks for visibility, but the PMS, CRM, and spreadsheet all show slightly different delinquency status.
- Escalations happen too late because no workflow is watching the clock between reminder stages.

This is not just a collections discipline problem. It is a workflow design problem.

## What delinquency outreach automation should actually do

The goal is not to let software chase every resident blindly. The goal is to create a controlled outreach path where routine reminders happen on time and exceptions surface with context before they become occupancy, legal, or owner-trust problems.

That means the workflow should:

1. Detect when a verified balance reaches the next reminder or escalation threshold.
2. Send the approved message for that stage through the right channel.
3. Capture resident replies, payment promises, and disputes in a shared timeline.
4. Hold or reroute automation when the account needs a human decision.
5. Write the full outreach history back to the operating system so onsite teams, leadership, and owners stay aligned.

If that process is clean, everything downstream improves: on-time follow-up, clearer owner reporting, fewer manual status checks, and less avoidable confusion around who owes what and what should happen next.

## The delinquency checkpoints worth automating first

Most property management teams do not need a complicated AI layer first. They need a few reliable operational checkpoints.

Start with:

- verified due date and balance status
- reminder stage reached without payment
- promise-to-pay captured and due for follow-up
- resident dispute or hardship reply detected
- legal or manager escalation threshold reached
- owner-facing status summary updated from live account data
- payment posted and the reminder sequence stopped automatically

Those checkpoints are enough to tell whether the account should continue through routine outreach, pause for review, or move into a more serious exception path.

## Where automation should stop

Delinquency outreach automation should narrow the follow-up work, not replace judgment.

If the resident disputes the balance, requests accommodation, raises a legal concern, sends an emotionally charged reply, or the account requires market-specific compliance judgment, the workflow should stop and hand the case to trained staff with context.

The point is to remove repetitive reminder chasing while making it easier for trained staff to step in at the right moment with the right record.

## How EMC2Ops would implement it

We would start by mapping how your team currently handles past-due balances: what events trigger reminders, who tracks promise-to-pay commitments, when ownership needs visibility, which accounts escalate fastest, and which replies should always stop automation. Then we would define which stages can move on rules alone and which conditions should force a human checkpoint.

From there we would set:

1. The verified balance and due-date triggers for each reminder stage.
2. The reply handling for promises to pay, partial payments, disputes, and hardship signals.
3. The owner, onsite, and leadership visibility rules tied to live delinquency status.
4. The exception paths for compliance review, legal escalation, and high-risk accounts.
5. The PMS, CRM, and reporting write-backs that preserve the full payment-follow-up timeline.

If your team still manages delinquency follow-up from inboxes and spreadsheets instead of a structured workflow, this is a strong place to automate next.`,
