  body: `The owner approval queue should not live in somebody's inbox.

Someone is waiting on a repair estimate. Someone else needs approval for a make-ready overage. Leasing wants a concession answer. Accounting has an invoice exception. Each request gets sent a different way, with different context, and nobody is sure when to escalate.

For operators managing 50 or more units, owner approvals become a hidden operational tax. They create preventable delays, repeated follow-up, and inconsistent decision records because each request has to be rebuilt by hand every time.

## Why owner approvals break so often

The pattern is usually predictable:

- Approval thresholds live in staff memory, not in a shared workflow.
- Requests are sent without enough cost, urgency, resident, or turn context for the owner to decide quickly.
- Nobody knows whether the owner saw the message, when to follow up, or when the request should escalate internally.
- The final decision never writes back cleanly to the work order, invoice, turn, or leasing record.

This is not just a communication discipline problem. It is a workflow design problem.

## What owner approval automation should actually do

The goal is not to let software approve spend blindly. The goal is to create a controlled approval workflow where policy-based requests move fast, exceptions arrive with context, and every decision lands back in the operating record.

That means the workflow should:

1. Detect when a request crosses an approval threshold.
2. Pull together the estimate, scope, urgency, photos, policy notes, and recommended next action automatically.
3. Send the request to the right owner contact with a defined response window.
4. Escalate silence or ambiguity before the work stalls.
5. Write the final decision back to the system that needs to act on it.

If that process is clean, everything downstream improves: repair speed, turn coordination, invoice handling, owner trust, and the team's ability to prove who approved what and when.

## The owner-approval checkpoints worth automating first

Most property management teams do not need a complicated AI layer first. They need a few reliable approval checkpoints.

Start with:

- repair estimates over the owner's threshold
- make-ready scope changes that affect cost or timeline
- invoice exceptions that do not match the approved work
- leasing concessions or policy exceptions that require sign-off
- no-response escalations when an approval window expires
- final decisions synced back to the work order, turn plan, or invoice record

Those checkpoints are enough to tell whether work can move, needs clarification, or should pause for human review.

## Where automation should stop

Owner approval automation should narrow the chase work, not replace judgment.

If the decision involves habitability exposure, legal risk, fair housing, resident disputes, unusual owner politics, or a negotiation that needs context beyond the workflow record, the system should stop and hand the case to staff with the right supporting details.

The point is to remove repetitive approval chasing while making it easier for trained staff to step in with a cleaner record.

## How EMC2Ops would implement it

We would start by mapping where owner approval gets triggered in your operation: repairs, turns, invoices, leasing concessions, delinquency settlements, or exceptions. Then we would define who approves what, how fast they need to respond, what evidence they need, and what should happen if they do not answer in time.

From there we would set:

1. The approval thresholds and fallback rules by owner, property, and workflow type.
2. The request packet fields required before an approval can be sent.
3. The reminder and escalation timing for unanswered requests.
4. The PMS, CRM, and vendor or accounting write-backs that preserve each decision.
5. The metrics that show whether approval drag is actually shrinking.

If your team still handles owner approvals through scattered inbox threads and manual reminders, this workflow is a strong place to automate next.`,
